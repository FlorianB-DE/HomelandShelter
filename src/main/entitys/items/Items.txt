# this is a comment
# comments are not recognized by the ItemReader as well as empty lines
#
# edit this file to add or remove items to the game
# an item is described as follows:
# Name{ open bracket
#	attribute: value
#	accepted values are: Text = "value", floating point number 32bit = 1.23, integer = 123
# } close bracket
# for an actual item "normal" brackets have to be used
# the way this file is read prohibits from writing "normal" brackets outside item declaration
#
# the "behavior" attribute determines how the item behaves when clicked by the user in inventory view
# please enter EXACT class names! A new behavior can be added by adding a new class extends Behavior in /main.entitys.items.behavior
# "texture" attributes need a corresponding .png or .gif file in /textures e.g.: "FIRE" = "FIRE.png" or "FIRE.gif"
# all other attributes are optional! When there is none or the wrong type the default value for every missing but expected value is 0
# e.g.: behavior: "MainHand" and no damage attribute given adds no extra attack damage when equipped
