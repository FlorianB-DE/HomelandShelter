# Homeland Shelter
A Game I developed a while ago with two friends of mine (a programmer and an artist). Currently it's unfinished as I'm planning to switch to Unity. 
We developed this game from the ground up as our first big project. As it grew it became insanely hard to refactor and expand uppon.

But as of know this is a semi working game with an item system, procedual dungeon generation (the only issue is the door generation), inventory, equipment, basic combat, enemy generation, etc.

The code is probably outdated by now and the structure is a complete mess as my understanding of production ready code had to build up over time. 

Credit to Tim Bauer(@bautim) for implementing the A* Algorythm and Melvin Lannatewitz for creating these awsome sprites.
